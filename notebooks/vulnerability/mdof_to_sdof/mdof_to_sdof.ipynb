    "# MDOF pushover curves to equivalent SDOF capacity curves\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature of the Risk Modeller's Toolkit enables the user to derive equivalent single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) capacity curves from multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structures. Several structural analysis packages allow the user to perform a reliable pushover analysis on a nonlinear model of the MDOF structure. The results of the pushover analysis (in terms of a pushover curve) can be provided as input to one of the methods in this module. This module allows the conversion of the MDOF results into 'equivalent SDOF' results, thus making them compatible with a wide range of non-linear static procedures. At present, two methods are provided in this module for obtaining equivalent SDOF capacity curves for an MDOF system."

The supplied pushover curve, which is in terms of base shear and roof displacement, is transformed into an equivalent SDOF capacity curve, which is in terms of spectral acceleration and spectral displacement.\n",
