    "# MDOF pushover curves to equivalent SDOF capacity curves\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature of the Risk Modeller's Toolkit enables the user to derive equivalent single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) capacity curves for multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structures. The first step is to perform a reliable pushover analysis on a nonlinear model of the MDOF structure usign a structural analysis software. The results of the pushover analysis (in terms of a pushover curve) are provided as input to one of the methods in this module. The ‘equivalent SDOF adaptive capacity curve’ is then derived by calculating the equivalent system displacement. At present, two methods are provided in this module for obtaining equivalent SDOF capacity curves for an MDOF system."

    "This method requires the user to provide the first mode of vibration of the structure. The supplied pushover curve, which is in terms of base shear and roof displacement, is transformed into an equivalent SDOF capacity curve, which is in terms of spectral acceleration and spectral displacement.\n",
