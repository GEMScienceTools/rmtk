    "The Risk Modellerâ€™s Toolkit (rmtk) is a suite of tools written by scientists, which supports engineers and other experts in the visualization of the outputs of the OpenQuake-engine, in the calculation of specific risk metrics, and creation of fragility and vulnerability models. This software contains some of the most commonly used algorithms for risk and vulnerability assessment, and it is intended to be an ever growing tool. The current architecture of the Risk Modeller's Toolkit is depicted in the figure below:<br />\n",
