    "# Derivation of fragility and vulnerability models\n",
    "\n",
    "This module comprises a wide spectrum methodologies to assess the nonlinear response of one, or multiple, structures using nonlinear static procedures. One of the main outputs of this module are fragility functions, which can be converted into a vulnerability model using a damage-to-loss (i.e. consequence) model. It is important to mention that the vast majority of the methodologies implemented herein were not developed so derive fragility models, but simple to assess the nonlinear structural response of single structures. Therefore, their employment in fragility derivation needs to be performed with due care, and recognizing all of the inherent limitations. <br />\n",

    "##1 - Direct Nonlinear Static Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "These methodologies estimate the median seismic intensity values corresponding to the attainment of the damage state of interest, taking into account record-to-record dispersion and dispersion in the damage state thresholds. The inelastic displacements are estimated from the maximum elastic displacements by means of an R-mu-T relationship.\n",

    "###1.1 - SPO2IDA (2006)\n",
    "This methodology uses the SPO2IDA tool (Vamvatsikos and Cornell, 2006) to convert static pushover curves into 16%, 50%, and 84% IDA curves. The procedure is applicable to any kind of multi-linear capacity curve and it is suitable for single-building fragility curve estimation. Individual fragility curves can later be combined in a unique fragility curve that considers the inter-building uncertainty.

    "Equivalent linearization methods allow to estimate a demand spectrum that can properly take into account the inelastic behaviour of the structures under analysis, namely, their capacity of dissipating energy through hysteresis (Monteiro, 2011). This can be achieved either by the use of modification factors or by considering an equivalent linear system.\n",

    "This procedure aims to determine the displacements from an inelastic design spectra for systems with a given ductility factor. The inelastic displacement spectra is determined by means of applying a reduction factor, which depends on the natural period of the system, its ductility factor, the hysteretic behaviour, the damping, and the frequency content of the ground motion.

A reduction factor based on the displacement ductility ratio and the period of vibration of the system is used to estimate the inelastic displacements, which are then used as inputs to build the fragility model.

This method has been developed to be combined with code-bsed response spectra, but is is also possible to employ it to assess structural response against ground motion records. It also has the distinct aspect of assuming an elasto-perfectly plastic force-displacement relationship in the construction of the bilinear curve.

The nonlinear capacity can be estimated using the displacement-based earthquake loss assessment theory. In this process, the performance against a large set of ground motion records is been calculated. Global limit states are used to estimate the distribution of buildings in each damage state for different levels of ground motion, and a regression algorithm is applied to derive fragility functions for each limit state.
